Experimental project intended to replace strange modding language for Paradox games with Kotlin DSL.

Probably it could be a Gradle plugin that can do two things:
- Generate Kotlin library code from Paradox game files
- Generate Paradox game mod files from a Kotlin code user wrote 

This way it would be possible to use Kotlin for modding without using Paradox modding language. And use existing Kotlin
tooling instead of the [IDEA plugin](https://github.com/DragonKnightOfBreeze/Paradox-Language-Support).

I'm not really familiar with Paradox games scripting architecture, but this feels doable.
